<h1>Vector Implementation</h1>
<hr>
<i> <br> std::vector is a container in C++ that is implemented as a dynamic array. It is part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and provides a convenient way to store and manipulate a sequence of elements. </i>
<hr>
<b>
The std::vector container can store objects of any type, including built-in types like int or double, as well as user-defined types such as classes or structs. The size of the vector can be changed dynamically, which means elements can be added or removed from the vector during runtime. </b>
<hr>

If you want to compile this code.
You must write

```
g++ -std=c++2a main.cpp implementation.hpp

```

and then if you want to run this code you must write

```
./a.out 

```
